# Monster Hunter World Cheat Sheet

Currently being built.

This checklist was created by adopting the source code from [Dark Souls 3 Cheat Sheet](http://zkjellberg.github.io/dark-souls-3-cheat-sheet/)

## Contribution Guide

For some background on how the guide code is written, here is a sample item on the checklist.

```
<li data-id="playthrough_27_1" class="f_quest">Finish <a href="https://mhworld.kiranico.com/quest/jagras-of-the-ancient-forest">HR1&#9733; Jagras of the Ancient Forest</a></li>
```

The **data-id** is a unique ID used to store the user's progress. For example, ***playthrough_17_12*** was the 12th task in zone 17. You can add new elements out of order, but they must be added in ascending order.

The filter system from the DS3 checklist has been removed but might be added in later on if I have the time.
